## Aim of the game
Electrobots are sent down the mines of Terranova to find diamonds. Collect all diamonds to finish a level. If you get stuck, press `ESCAPE` for the Pause Menu and then `R` to restart the level. Watch out for enemies and spikes; they will quickly drain your energy (and lives). Collect batteries to replenish your energy and find hearts for extra lives. Use crates wisely to find your way across some levels. Can you safely guide our little robot friends through all 16 levels?
